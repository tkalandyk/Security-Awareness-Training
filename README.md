## 🛡️ Security Awareness Training  
### Bridging the Gap Between Cybersecurity & Sales  
📘 GitHub Project Overview

---

### 🧭 What this project is about

This project is designed as a **training-style scenario** where the **Cybersecurity Team** meets with the **Sales Team** to help bridge the gap between:

- **What cybersecurity actually does**
- **How employee behavior directly affects company security**
- **Why non-technical teams play a critical role in protecting the business**

Using **real login activity from the last 24 hours**, this scenario shows how often **bad actors** attempt to access company systems — and how **everyday employee actions** help protect the company’s mission.

---

### 🎯 Primary Goal

> **Build a company-wide security culture rooted in CIA**
>
> 🔒 Confidentiality  
> ✔ Integrity  
> ⚡ Availability

---

## 🤝 Security Team Meeting with the Sales Team

Thanks for taking a few minutes to meet with us.

We’re **not here** to talk about tools, firewalls, or technical jargon.

We’re here to show you **what’s happening behind the scenes** —  
and **why it matters to you, your customers, and your ability to sell.**

---

### 👀 What you’re looking at

👇 Below is a **real snapshot from the last 24 hours** across company computers:

<img width="579" height="448" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48c9f7c0-a69b-4411-89cd-556a8241e5e8" />


Each number represents a **bad actor repeatedly trying to guess passwords** and gain access to employee accounts.

Some devices were hit **hundreds of times in a single day**.

This happens **every day** — even when no one notices.

---

### 💡 A key point to understand

> **Bad actors don’t target people or departments.**  
> **They target access.**

Sales accounts are especially valuable because they connect **directly** to:

- Customers  
- Revenue  
- Trust  

---

## ⚠️ Why This Matters to YOU in Sales

---

### 🔓 1️⃣ If a bad actor accesses your account, your customers are at risk

Someone logged in as you can:

- Email customers pretending to be you  
- Request documents or payments  
- Send malicious links  
- Damage trust instantly  

**How this affects you:**
- Deals stall or fall apart  
- Client confidence drops  
- Your professional reputation takes a hit  

No one wants to explain to a customer that *their account was compromised*.

---

### 🧨 2️⃣ One compromised sales account can shut down systems

If access is gained, the company may need to:

- Disable email  
- Lock CRM access  
- Shut down internal tools  
- Pause operations to contain the threat  

**How this affects you:**
- No CRM  
- No email  
- No quoting tools  
- No selling  
- No commissions while systems recover  

One weak password can create a **company-wide outage**.

---

### 💰 3️⃣ Exposure of sales data leads to lost revenue

Sales teams handle:

- Customer lists  
- Pricing  
- Contracts  
- Renewal information  

If this data is exposed:

- Customers must be notified  
- Deals slow or stop  
- Renewals are questioned  
- Competitors gain leverage  

**How this affects you:**
- Longer sales cycles  
- Lost deals  
- Lower close rates  

Trust is hard to earn — and easy to lose.

---

### 🎭 4️⃣ Impersonation leads to fraud

Bad actors often impersonate sales employees because customers **trust you**.

Imagine a client receiving an email that looks like it came from you asking for updated payment information.

**How this affects you:**
- Damaged relationships  
- Internal investigations  
- Account restrictions  
- Lost time and credibility  

---

## 🔐 Why Security Controls Exist (Even the Annoying Ones)

We get it — security requirements can be frustrating:

- Password resets  
- Long passwords  
- MFA prompts  
- No sharing or writing passwords down  

Here’s why they exist — and how they protect **you**.

---

### 🔁 Password resets every 90 days

Bad actors use stolen passwords from other breaches and try them here.

**Why this helps you:**  
Resets cut off access **before** stolen passwords can be used against your account.

---

### 🔑 Strong passwords / passphrases

Short or common passwords are guessed quickly — the screenshot proves it.

**Why this helps you:**  
Strong passphrases protect your email, CRM access, customers, and deals.

---

### 📲 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA confirms it’s really you.

**Why this helps you:**  
Even if a password is guessed, MFA blocks access and protects your reputation.

---

### 🚫 No sticky notes, shared passwords, or reuse

Bad actors look for the easiest path in.

**Why this helps you:**  
It prevents your account from becoming the doorway into company systems — keeping sales tools available.

---

## 🏛️ How This Supports the Company’s CIA Mission

Everything we’ve discussed protects the foundation of how the company operates:

🔒 **Confidentiality**  
Customer data, pricing, contracts, sales strategy  

✔ **Integrity**  
Accurate records, trusted communication, clean deals  

⚡ **Availability**  
Email, CRM, quoting tools, commission workflows  

Sales success depends on **all three**.

---

## 🤝 Final Takeaway

The cybersecurity team monitors threats and blocks attacks every day.

But we can’t prevent:

- Weak passwords  
- Ignored MFA prompts  
- Shared credentials  
- Unsafe shortcuts  

That’s where **every employee** — especially Sales — plays a role.

> 🧠 **Cybersecurity protects your customers, your deals, your commissions, and your career.**

When Sales and Security work together, the **entire company stays secure**.
