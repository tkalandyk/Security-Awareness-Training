🛡️ Security Awareness Training
Bridging the Gap Between Cybersecurity & Sales
📘 GitHub Project Overview

This project is designed as a training-style scenario where the Cybersecurity Team meets with the Sales Team to help bridge the gap between:

• What cybersecurity actually does
• How employee behavior directly affects company security
• Why non-technical teams play a critical role in protecting the business

Using real login activity from the last 24 hours, this scenario shows how often bad actors attempt to access company systems and how everyday actions by employees help protect the company’s mission.

🎯 Goal: Build a company-wide security culture rooted in CIA
Confidentiality • Integrity • Availability

👋 Security Team Meeting With the Sales Team

Thanks for taking a few minutes to meet with us.

We’re not here to talk about tools, firewalls, or technical jargon.
We’re here to show you what’s happening behind the scenes — and why it matters to you, your customers, and your ability to sell.

👇 Below is a real snapshot from the last 24 hours across company computers:

📸 (Insert screenshot here)

Each number represents a bad actor repeatedly trying to guess passwords and gain access to employee accounts.

Some devices were hit hundreds of times in a single day.

This happens every day, even when no one notices.

💡 Bad actors don’t target people or departments.
They target access.

Sales accounts are valuable because they connect directly to customers, revenue, and trust.

⚠️ Why This Matters to YOU in Sales
🔓 1️⃣ If a bad actor accesses your account, your customers are at risk

Someone logged in as you can:

• Email customers pretending to be you
• Request documents or payments
• Send malicious links
• Damage trust instantly

👉 How this affects you:
Deals stall or fall apart.
Client confidence drops.
Your reputation takes a hit.

No one wants to explain to a customer that their account was compromised.

🧨 2️⃣ One compromised sales account can shut down systems

If access is gained, the company may need to:

• Disable email
• Lock CRM access
• Shut down internal tools
• Pause operations to contain the threat

👉 How this affects you:
No CRM.
No email.
No quoting tools.
No selling.
No commissions while systems recover.

One weak password can create a company-wide outage.

💰 3️⃣ Exposure of sales data leads to lost revenue

Sales teams handle:

• Customer lists
• Pricing
• Contracts
• Renewal information

If this data is exposed:

• Customers must be notified
• Deals slow or stop
• Renewals are questioned
• Competitors gain leverage

👉 How this affects you:
Longer sales cycles.
Lost deals.
Lower close rates.

Trust is hard to earn — and easy to lose.

🎭 4️⃣ Impersonation leads to fraud

Bad actors often impersonate sales employees because customers trust you.

Imagine a client receiving an email that looks like it came from you asking for updated payment information.

👉 How this affects you:
Damaged relationships.
Internal investigations.
Account restrictions.
Lost time and credibility.

🔐 Why We Enforce Security Controls (Yes, Even the Annoying Ones)

We get it. Security requirements can feel frustrating:

• Password resets
• Long passwords
• MFA prompts
• No sharing or writing passwords down

Here’s why they exist — and how they protect you.

🔁 Password resets every 90 days

Bad actors use stolen passwords from other breaches and try them here.

👉 Why this helps you:
Resets cut off access before stolen passwords can be used against your account.

🔑 Strong passwords / passphrases

Short or common passwords are guessed quickly — the screenshot proves it.

👉 Why this helps you:
Strong passphrases protect your email, CRM access, customers, and deals.

📲 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA confirms it’s really you.

👉 Why this helps you:
Even if a password is guessed, MFA blocks access and protects your reputation.

🚫 No sticky notes, shared passwords, or reuse

Bad actors look for the easiest path in.

👉 Why this helps you:
It prevents your account from becoming the doorway into company systems — keeping sales tools available.

🎯 How This Supports the Company’s CIA Mission

Everything we’ve discussed protects the foundation of how the company operates:

🔒 Confidentiality
Customer data, pricing, contracts, sales strategy

✔ Integrity
Accurate records, trusted communication, clean deals

⚡ Availability
Email, CRM, quoting tools, commission workflows

Sales success depends on all three.

One compromised account can impact them all.

🤝 Final Message

The cybersecurity team monitors threats and blocks attacks every day.

But we can’t prevent:

• Weak passwords
• Ignored MFA prompts
• Shared credentials
• Unsafe shortcuts

That’s where every employee — especially Sales — plays a role.

🧠 Cybersecurity protects your customers, your deals, your commissions, and your career.

When Sales and Security work together, the entire company stays secure.
